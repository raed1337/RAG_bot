Make sure to update the policy whenever needed and communicate to employees all the updates and modifications, if any. The policy should include: General goals of the policy, Roles and responsibilities of the parties, General conditions for taking leave from work, Rules and procedures, i.e.: - Employee's obligations (e.g.: to notify the supervisor in advance) - Concrete actions to be taken - Documents to be completed or provided - Deadlines for taking actions - Possible disciplinary sanctions in case of non-compliance. IV.2. - Remedy/recommendations section (Request for confirmation of termination of employment) It is not recommended to dismiss an employee, having more than 2 years of continuous service, without following a certain gradation of sanctions, ranging from a written warning, to increasingly severe suspensions until dismissal. Unless there is a very serious offence or the employee has a very loaded disciplinary file. Otherwise it is better to be prudent and proceed with a gradation of disciplinary sanctions. It must be shown that all the sanctions were applied gradually and that the employee was invited to change his behaviour. In addition, and more importantly, when the employer is aware of a substance abuse problem that is considered a disability under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter creates a duty to accommodate for the employer, which generally translates into the need to refer the employee to an assistance program such as the Maison Jean Lapointe. Since the employee has less than 2 years of continuous service and according to the severity of the incident and the personal disciplinary record, you may: M) Proceed with the progressive disciplinary sanctions or O) Terminate the employment. After my recommendation, will you let me know what is your intention now. M) Proceed with the progressive disciplinary sanctions O) Terminate the employment. Final Recommendations Section V.2 - Reasonable Accommodation If the employee is experiencing a difficult personal situation, be a good listener. You may, at your discretion, take reasonable steps to help the employee in difficulty. For example, you could, if necessary, temporarily reduce the workload or refer the employee to an employee assistance program. You may require the employee to provide a document attesting to the situation (e.g., medical bill, death certificate). If the employee mentions that he or she has a handicap, health or medical problems or substance addiction problems, be a good listener. You should require the employee to provide a document signed by a physician attesting to the employee's medical condition. If the employee provides such medical evidence, then you must ensure the reliability of that document and make reasonable accommodations for that employee, if necessary. Disciplinary actions shall be suspended until the employee's recovery. Did you know that, according to Act respecting labour standards, the employee is entitled to 5 days of absence from work, including 2 paid days, in the event of the death or the funeral of: his or her spouse, her child, the child of his or her spouse, his father or mother, his brother or sister. The employee is entitled to 1 day of absence from work without pay in the event of the death or funeral of: a son-in-law or daughter-in-law, one of his grandparents, one of his grandchildren, the father or mother of his or her spouse, a brother or sister of his or her spouse. Reference: Act respecting labour standards, sections 80 and 80.1. In the event of absence due to the death or funeral of a family member, the employee must advise the employer of his absence as soon as possible. You also have the right to ask the employee to provide a document attesting to the death or any other appropriate document (e.g.: death certificate). Reference: Act respecting labour standards, section 80.2. Remember that you have the right to determine the timing of the vacation. However, the employee is entitled to know the date of his annual vacation at least four weeks in advance. The length of the annual vacation and the amount of the annual vacation indemnity are determined according to the number of years of uninterrupted service at the end of the reference year. Reference: Act respecting labour standards, sections 66 et 72. Nevertheless, you may administer a disciplinary warning for the employee's absence following a refusal of days off or vacation. V- Correct behaviour with progressive disciplinary sanctions Alright, given the information shared today, here are the options available to you: - Request that the employee provides medical evidence regarding the medical condition as soon as possible. - If the employee fails to provide medical proof, you may administer: Alright, given the shared information today, here are the options available to you. Please note that this recommendation takes into account the employee's actions severity, gravity and the past sanction gradation applicable to the past employment record. You may administer: A) Verbal warning B) Written warning C) 1-day suspension D) 2-day suspension E) 3-day suspension F) 4-day suspension G) 5-day suspension. You will also have to make a point with the employee that absences following a refusal of a day off or a vacation will not be tolerated and, moreover, sanctioned more and more severely until dismissal. VI - Termination An employer who does not give sufficient notice of termination of employment must pay the worker an indemnity. The indemnity must be equal to the regular wages they would have earned between the date on which the notice should have been provided and the termination of their employment. Overtime must not be included when calculating the indemnity. Please note that the annual vacation period may not be included in the notice period, and that the worker's benefits must be maintained during the notice period. Unless there has been a serious fault, the law requires that you give a written notice terminating the employment of an employee. The length of the notice varies depending on the length of uninterrupted service of the employee with the employer. - less than three months - no notice - three months to less than a year - one week notice - one year to less than five years - two weeks notice - five years to less than ten years - four weeks notice - ten years and over - eight weeks notice. References: Act respecting labour standards, section. 82, 82.1 and 83. Warning: Please note that the indemnity provided for by the Act respecting labour standards is a minimum and that an employee can claim, in theory, a more generous indemnity in certain cases under the Civil Code of Quebec (C.c.Q, section 2091). In exchange, you could ask the employee to sign a waiver of his rights. However, the employee has no obligation to sign such a waiver. Remember that you must also give to the employee the amounts owed to him (for example pay, overtime, vacation pay).

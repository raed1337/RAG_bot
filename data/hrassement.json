    "recommendation": "Policy on the Prevention of Harassment\n\nAccording to the law, the employer must adopt and make available to their employees a harassment prevention and complaint processing policy that includes a section on behaviour involving verbal comments, actions or gestures of a sexual nature.\n\nMake sure to communicate the policy, and to update it whenever needed and communicate to employees all the updates and modifications, if any.\n\nBe aware that every employee has a right to a work environment free from psychological harassment.\n\nEmployers must therefore take reasonable action to prevent psychological harassment and, whenever they become aware of such behaviour, to put a stop to it.\n\nReference: Act respecting labour standards, section 81.19.\n\nReference: https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/en/prevention-and-safety/milieu-travail-sain-en/harassment-workplace/psychological-or-sexual-harassment-employers\n\nInvestigation of Harassment Allegations\n\nOur diagnosis leads us to conclude that the person subject of the complaint and/or the witnesses would not have provided their version of the alleged facts.\n\nInvestigation of Harassment Allegations\n\nI recommend that you proceed to an investigation, as soon as possible, to determine whether the alleged conduct could be characterized as harassment under section 81.18 of the Act respecting labour standards.\n\nInvestigation of Harassment Allegations\n\nIt will then be necessary to meet the alleged victim, the person targeted by the complaint and the witnesses in order to obtain their explanation before drawing any conclusions and judgment.\n\nInvestigation of Harassment Allegations\n\nRemember that the collection of testimonies must relate above all to objective facts (nature of the alleged actions, comments, behaviours, dates and witnesses).\n\nHere is a standard questionnaire that you can use (QS - harcèlement au travail).\n\nIn virtue of the Act respecting labour standards, sections 81.18 and 81.19:\n\n(1) To establish that there is harassment, it is necessary to demonstrate the presence of vexatious conduct on the part of the employee who is the subject of the harassment allegations.\n\n(2) Vexatious conduct manifests itself in hostile or unwanted behaviour, words, acts or gestures of a repetitive nature.\n\n(3) The abusive conduct must result in the dignity or integrity of the employee being harassed, and result in a harmful work environment.\n\nHarassment at Work: Dismissal of an employee with more than 2 years of service\n\nIf the harassment complaint is deemed to be well founded, but the employee responsible for the harassment has more than 2 years of service, then all the elements of the file must be considered to determine whether the behaviour complained of constitutes good and sufficient cause for dismissal.\n\nHowever, one can easily conclude that harassment is a particularly serious fault which generally justifies a dismissal.\n\nHarassment at Work: Disciplinary Sanctions\n\nIf the behaviour complained of is not of sufficient seriousness, it might be wise to consider disciplinary sanctions proportionate to the situation while bearing in mind that harassment is inherently serious misconduct.\n\nHarassment at Work: Remedial Actions\n\nThe conclusions drawn from your investigation will influence the steps that will be taken to correct the situation. For the employee who is the subject of the harassment allegations, you could:\n\n(1) Impose a disciplinary sanction based on the results of the investigation and the disciplinary record of the offending employee;\n\n(2) Offer activities and training on workplace harassment;\n\n(3) Take other reasonable measures to prevent or stop the harassment.\n\nReference: Act respecting labour standards, section 123.15.\n\nHarassment at Work: Remedial Actions (continued)\n\nWith regard to the alleged victim of harassment, you could, as the case may be:\n\n(1) Offer psychological support to the employee who is the victim of harassment;\n\n(2) Consider means to limit interactions between the person targeted by the allegations and the victim, particularly if the latter has requested it;\n\n(3) Modify an \"unjustified\" disciplinary record of the employee who is the victim of harassment;\n\n(4) Offer a letter of recommendation (if the complainant resigns).\n\nReference: Act respecting labour standards, section 123.15.\n\nHarassment at Work: Professional Injury\n\nIf the harassment results in an employment injury, that is to say an injury or illness which arises because, during the course of the work, the employee who is the victim of harassment may be entitled to a claim for compensation for professional injury under the Act respecting industrial accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nReference: Act respecting labour standards, section 123.16.\n\nNon-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement\n\nIt would also be important to suggest to both parties, the alleged victim and the employee affected by the complaint, to sign a non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement in an attempt to prevent rumours from circulating and reputations being tarnished. Here is a template you could use (PIÈCE JOINTE D'UNE ENTENTE NDA).\n\nRemember, at all times, that allegations of workplace harassment should always be taken seriously. If it is not harassment, the conduct may still be considered inappropriate and may possibly lead to harassment in the medium term. An upstream intervention is always preferable either by a generalized reminder of the applicable policies and / or a 'personalized' meeting with the employee concerned by the harassment complaint."
